### Hi there! My name is Ethan. I'm a product manager, with 4 years of experience in the solar and energy storage industry.

I am neurodiverse and narcoleptic, and this blog is about human experiences - in the renewables field and beyond.

I will be sharing my stories, conversations with good people in the industry, new ideas and technologies that could be industry-defining, and more!

The intersection of technology, people, and energy is incredibly engaging to me, and you can see this reflected in my [Github](https://github.com/etsea117). I explore blockchain, app development, data analysis and more. (BTW, I know my code is spaghetti - your feedback is greatly valued!)

I love the phenomonal role I have as a software product manager at one of the largest independent renewable energy companies in the world! Although that gives me unique perspective and experience - everything on this site is my own personal opinions and not necessarily reflective of the views of my company.
