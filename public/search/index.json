[{"content":"Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine executive function as a bowl of cereal. Every decision that needs to be made, fun or arduous, requires you to eat the whole bowl of cereal. As a child, you crunched through your cereal when your parents asked you too, but it hurt and you didn\u0026rsquo;t enjoy it. Everyone around you was eating their cereal just fine and didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be in any pain at all. You told people you didn\u0026rsquo;t like eating the cereal, that it was too difficult, and that it hurt to eat. Teachers and family members insisted that \u0026ldquo;You just need to try harder to eat the cereal!\u0026rdquo; but it didn\u0026rsquo;t matter how hard you tried, it still was difficult and painful. Fun activities and enjoyable experiences required multiple bowls of cereal to get through and you never managed to complete them.\nAs you got older, you realized that everyone else had milk in their cereal which made it possible to eat without pain. You looked in your fridge, but you didn\u0026rsquo;t have any milk there. Everyone else seemed to always wake up with a fresh gallon of milk in the fridge each day, and could eat many bowls of cereal before the milk ran out. You tried to force yourself to eat cereal, but each day you could only get through a couple before the pain was too much and you stopped eating entirely to give your bleeding mouth a rest. Remembering and being able to do homework from school takes more bowls of cereal than you can eat, and your parents and teachers get upset with you. Frustrated with your inability to eat enough cereal, they keep you after school and give you work to do while setting a bowl of cereal in front of you and staring at you while you eat it.\n\u0026ldquo;See? You can eat cereal just fine! Now just do this yourself every day.\u0026rdquo;\nYou try to explain that you don\u0026rsquo;t have any milk in your fridge, but they don\u0026rsquo;t seem to understand. They are also too proud of themselves for getting you to eat that bowl of cereal to really listen to what you are saying.\nReaching your teenage years, you begin to find ways of imitating the milk. You pour different liquids into your cereal, but that only helps a little and everyone can tell that your cereal is different. You still can\u0026rsquo;t eat as many bowls as everyone else, and society seems to be designed for people who can eat many bowls of cereal every day. You discover that if you pour alcohol in your cereal, it still doesn\u0026rsquo;t taste good and it still hurts, but you don\u0026rsquo;t feel the pain from it as much. It\u0026rsquo;s also easier to handle the embarrassment of not eating as many bowls of cereal as everyone expects you to eat.\nAfter many years, you hear about doctors who specialize in people who struggle to eat cereal. It takes a lot of bowls of cereal to find a doctor near you, schedule an appointment, and remember to go. And this is only possible when you\u0026rsquo;ve successfully forced enough bowls of painful cereal down to get and maintain a job which provides health insurance to pay for the doctor. Between first hearing about these doctors and actually being in the first appointment it\u0026rsquo;s been almost 5 years. You talk with the doctor about all of your struggles eating cereal due to not having any milk appear in your fridge each morning. Fortunately, this doctor isn\u0026rsquo;t one of the ones who believe that when you turn 18 you magically start finding milk in the fridge each morning. The doctor tells you that there is therapy specifically designed to help you. He also explains to you that he can authorize you to order a delivery of a half-gallon of milk each morning from a pharmacy nearby. It needs to be authorized because some people, who naturally get a gallon of milk in their fridge each day, are getting extra cartons of milk and chugging them right out of the carton until they get sick or cause problems for others.\nPhoto by Robin Worrall\nCautiously optimistic, you arrange for the milk delivery. The first day it arrives, you pour yourself a bowl of cereal, fill it with milk, take your first bite, and\u0026hellip;\nHoly Crap! It doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt! You dance for joy and start to do the things that you\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to do, but were locked behind multiple bowls of cereal. They\u0026rsquo;re not crazy activities, in fact they\u0026rsquo;re activities most people do regularly. But you treasure these activities because now you can actually eat the required amount of cereal without any pain. Reauthorizing the milk deliveries each month is annoying and requires using some of the previous month\u0026rsquo;s milk, but you\u0026rsquo;re happy to do so because it means you can begin to have some semblance of a \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; life.\n","date":"2022-05-31T21:39:46-06:00","image":"https://tired.energy/p/adhd-a-metaphor/sascha-bosshard-HRldvxTg6nM-unsplash_hubd1be4077e0cc88dafe452703798a239_2111938_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpeg","permalink":"https://tired.energy/p/adhd-a-metaphor/","title":"Adhd - a Metaphor"},{"content":"It was September 2018, and I was asleep in my car. I was in southern Minnesota, surrounded by corn, and parked next to a field that would soon become a 1 MW solar farm. It was 11 AM and I was waiting for the civil contractors to show up with the surveyor to stake out the perimeter of the site. I had my \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; work laptop open on the passenger seat of my Honda Civic coupe as my head kept nodding forward, with each nod lasting longer and longer until the I was woken up by a car horn. The civil contractors had pulled up in their work truck right across from me and were chuckling as I started awake. They drove up next to me and rolled down their window.\n\u0026ldquo;Took a nap waiting for us? I don\u0026rsquo;t blame ya!\u0026rdquo;\nThey clearly weren\u0026rsquo;t upset and found it to be a sensible chuckle. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re not going to bring our crew here today, ground\u0026rsquo;s about to be to wet and muddy.\u0026rdquo; I looked up at the sky and sure enough the clear sky had turned dark gray while I was snoozing, which meant an autumn downpour was on the way. As the contractors drove off, I was embarrassed but glad that nothing detrimental came from falling asleep in the middle of the day. I berated myself and swore that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t let my daytime exhaustion ruin things this time.\nThree months prior to this, I watched 75% of my coworkers get laid off from Tesla\u0026rsquo;s solar division and realized exactly how \u0026ldquo;stable\u0026rdquo; my job was. I was grateful that I managed to avoid this fate, as I enjoyed doing solar sales and I particularly enjoyed having health insurance. Unfortunately, this restructuring turned a 15 minute commute in South Jersey (southern New Jersey) into an hour and a half drive through Philadelphia to King of Prussia. I was asked to train the car salespeople at the Tesla store in the mall how to sell solar to the people who wandered in from the Apple store next door. Tired of 8 shots of espresso a day to make it through the drive and the 8 hours in a mall, I began looking for another option.\nPhoto by Kevin Butz\nI reached out to a friend who was doing O\u0026amp;M work on utility-scale solar farms to see if he could help me find a job on the construction side of the solar industry. Did I know that O\u0026amp;M meant Operations and Maintenance? Absolutely not. All I knew was that I wanted to stay in the solar industry, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t keep going with what I was doing.\nThis company that my buddy worked for was looking for construction managers to go onsite and oversee the building of 1 MW solar farms in southern Minnesota. Sure it might be a job I\u0026rsquo;ve never done, in a place I\u0026rsquo;ve never been, but a change of pace sounded real pleasant to me. 3 phone interviews, 24 sugar-free Monster energy drinks, and 1,212 miles later I pulled into a Motel6 in Mankato, Minnesota. It was mid-August 2018 and I was ready to build some renewable energy, find my passion, and probably save the world from climate change.\nMain character syndrome much?\n~To Be Continued~ ","date":"2022-05-31T21:28:40-06:00","image":"https://tired.energy/p/first-things-first-im-tired/kate-stone-matheson-uy5t-CJuIK4-unsplash_hubc39725bdede73ccaea364f214b05f10_930788_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpeg","permalink":"https://tired.energy/p/first-things-first-im-tired/","title":"First Things First - I'm Tired"}]
