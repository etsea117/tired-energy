&lt;p&gt;I was in southern Minnesota, surrounded by corn, and parked next to a field that would soon become a 1 MW solar farm. It was 11 AM and I was waiting for the civil contractors to show up with the surveyor to stake out the perimeter of the site. I had my &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; work laptop open on the passenger seat of my Honda Civic coupe as my head kept nodding forward, with each nod lasting longer and longer until the I was woken up by a car horn. The civil contractors had pulled up in their work truck right across from me and were chuckling as I started awake. They drove up next to me and rolled down their window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Took a nap waiting for us? I don&amp;rsquo;t blame ya!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They clearly weren&amp;rsquo;t upset and found it to be a sensible chuckle. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re not going to bring our crew here today, ground&amp;rsquo;s about to be to wet and muddy.&amp;rdquo; I looked up at the sky and sure enough the clear sky had turned dark gray while I was snoozing, which meant an autumn downpour was on the way. As the contractors drove off, I was embarrassed but glad that nothing detrimental came from falling asleep in the middle of the day. I berated myself and swore that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t let my daytime exhaustion ruin things this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three months prior to this,&lt;/strong&gt; I watched 75% of my coworkers get laid off from Tesla&amp;rsquo;s solar division and realized exactly how &amp;ldquo;stable&amp;rdquo; my job was. I was grateful that I managed to avoid this fate, as I enjoyed doing solar sales and I particularly enjoyed having health insurance. Unfortunately, this restructuring turned a 15 minute commute in South Jersey (southern New Jersey) into an hour and a half drive through Philadelphia to King of Prussia. I was asked to train the car salespeople at the Tesla store in the mall how to sell solar to the people who wandered in from the Apple store next door. Tired of 8 shots of espresso a day to make it through the drive and the 8 hours in a mall, I began looking for another option.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached out to a friend who was doing O&amp;amp;M work on utility-scale solar farms to see if he could help me find a job on the construction side of the solar industry. Did I know that O&amp;amp;M meant Operations and Maintenance? Absolutely not. All I knew was that I wanted to stay in the solar industry, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep going with what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This company that my buddy worked for was looking for construction managers to go onsite and oversee the building of 1 MW solar farms in southern Minnesota. Sure it might be a job I&amp;rsquo;ve never done, in a place I&amp;rsquo;ve never been, but a change of pace sounded real pleasant to me. 3 phone interviews, 24 sugar-free Monster energy drinks, and 1,212 miles later I pulled into a Motel6 in Mankato, Minnesota. It was mid-August 2018 and I was ready to build some renewable energy, find my passion, and probably save the world from climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main character syndrome much?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;hi-there-my-name-is-ethan-im-a-product-manager-with-4-years-of-experience-in-the-solar-and-energy-storage-industry&#34;&gt;Hi there! My name is Ethan. I&amp;rsquo;m a product manager, with 4 years of experience in the solar and energy storage industry.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am neurodiverse and narcoleptic, and this blog is about human experiences - in the renewables field and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be sharing my stories, conversations with good people in the industry, new ideas and technologies that could be industry-defining, and more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intersection of technology, people, and energy is incredibly engaging to me, and you can see this reflected in my &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/etsea117&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. I explore blockchain, app development, data analysis and more. (BTW, I know my code is spaghetti - your feedback is greatly valued!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the phenomonal role I have as a software product manager at one of the largest independent renewable energy companies in the world! Although that gives me unique perspective and experience - everything on this site is my own personal opinions and is not necessarily reflective of the views of my company.&lt;/p&gt;
