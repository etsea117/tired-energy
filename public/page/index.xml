        <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;hi-there-my-name-is-ethan-im-a-product-manager-with-4-years-of-experience-in-the-solar-and-energy-storage-industry&#34;&gt;Hi there! My name is Ethan. I&amp;rsquo;m a product manager, with 4 years of experience in the solar and energy storage industry.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am neurodiverse and narcoleptic, and this blog is about human experiences - in the renewables field and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be sharing my stories, conversations with good people in the industry, new ideas and technologies that could be industry-defining, and more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intersection of technology, people, and energy is incredibly engaging to me, and you can see this reflected in my &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/etsea117&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. I explore blockchain, app development, data analysis and more. (BTW, I know my code is spaghetti - your feedback is greatly valued!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the phenomonal role I have as a software product manager at one of the largest independent renewable energy companies in the world! Although that gives me unique perspective and experience - everything on this site is my own personal opinions and is not necessarily reflective of the views of my company.&lt;/p&gt;
